# :bulb: An Enlightening Guide to Machine Learning Interviews :orange_book: :computer: :robot: 

:label: Notes: 
* This repo is under continuous development, and any feedback and contribution are very welcome :blush: 
**If you'd like to contribute**, please make a pull request with your suggested changes). 

* This repo aims to be an enlightening guideline to prepare for **Machine Learning / AI technical interviews**. It has compiled based on my personal experience and notes from my own ML interview preparation early 2020, when I received offers from Facebook (ML Specialist), Google (ML Engineer), Amazon (Applied Scientist), Apple (Applied Scientist), and Roku.

* At the time I'm putting these notes together, machine learning interviews at different companies do not follow a unique structure unlike software engineering interviews. However, I found some of the components very similar to each other, although under different naming.

* My preparation was focused mostly for *Machine Learning Engineer* (and Applied Scientist) roles at big companies. Although relevant roles such as "Data Science" or "ML research scientist" have different structures, some of the modules reviewed here can be still useful. For more understanding about different technical roles within ML umbrella you can refer to [Link]

* As a supplementary resource, you can also refer to my [Production Level Deep Learning](https://github.com/alirezadir/Production-Level-Deep-Learning) repo for further insights on how to design deep learning systems for production. 

The following components are the most commonly used interview modules that I found for technical ML roles at different companies. We will go through them one by one and share how one can prepare:

1. [General Coding Interview (Algorithms and Data Structures)](#coding)
2. [ML/Data Coding](#ml-coding)
3. [ML Depth](#depth)
3. [ML Breadth](#breadth)
5. [Machine Learning System Design](#ml-sys)




# <a name="coding"></a> 1. General Coding Interview (Algorithms and Data Structures) :computer: 

As an ML engineer, you're first expected to have a good understanding of general software engineering concepts, and in particular, basic algorithms and data structure.

Depending on the company and seniority level, there are usually one or two rounds of general coding interviews. The general coding interview is very similar to SW engineer coding interviews, and one can get prepared for this one same as other SW engineering roles.

## Leetcode

At this time, [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) is the most popular place to practice coding questions. I practiced with around 350 problems, which were roughly distributed as **55% Medium, 35% Easy, and 15% Hard** problems. You can find some information on the questions that I practiced in [Ma Leet Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A8GIgCIn7gvnwE-ZBymI-4-5_ZxQfyeQu99N6f5gEGk/edit#gid=656844248) - Yea I tried to have a little bit fun with it here and there to make the pain easier to carry :D (I will write on my approach to leetcode in the future.)

## Educative.io

I was introduced to [educative.io](https://www.educative.io/) by a friend of mine, and soon found it super useful in understanding the concepts of CS algorithms in more depth via their nice visualizations as well as categorizations.
In particular, I found the [Grokking the Coding Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview) pretty helpful in organizing my mind on approaching interview questions with similar patterns. And the [Grokking Dynamic Programming Patterns for Coding Interviews](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-dynamic-programming-patterns-for-coding-interviews) with a great categorization of DP patterns made tackling DP problems a piece of cake even though I was initially scared!

## Interview Kickstart
As I had never taken an algorithms course before and this was my first preparation for coding interviews, I decided to invest a bit in myself and took the [interview kickstart](https://www.interviewkickstart.com/)'s  technical interview prep course. In particular, my favorites were algorithms classes taught by [Omkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omkar-deshpande-2013588/), who dived deep in algorithms with his unique approach, the mock interviews, which well prepared my skill-sets for the main interviews. 

**Remember:** Interviewing is a skill and the more skillful you are, the better the results will be. Another part of the program that I learned a lot from (while many others ignored :D), was career coaching sessions.


# <a name="ml-coding"></a> 2. ML/Data Coding :robot:
ML coding module may or may not exist in particular companies interviews. The good news is that, there are a limited number of ML algorithms that candidates are expected to be able to code. The most common ones include:
- k-means clustering
- k-nearest neighbors
- Decision trees
- Perceptron, MLP
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- SVM
- Sampling
  - stratified sampling
  - uniform sampling
  - reservoir sampling
  - sampling multinomial distribution
  - random generator
- NLP algorithms (if that's your area of work)
  - bigrams
  - tf-idf

## Sample codes
- You can find some sample codes (or links to ones) in the [ML_Coding_Problems Notebook](https://github.com/alirezadir/machine-learning-interview-enlightener/blob/main/Notebooks/ML_Coding_Problems.ipynb).


# <a name="depth"></a> 3. ML Depth
ML depth interviews typically aim to measure the depth of your knowledge in both theoretical and practical machine learning, in particular in the area that you claim you have worked on. Although this may sound scary at the beginning, this could be potentially one of the easiest rounds if you know well what you have worked on before. In other words, ML depth interviews typically focus on your previous ML related projects, but as deep as possible!

Typically these sessions start with going through one of your past projects (which depending on the company, it could be either your or the interviewer's choice). It generally starts as a high level discussion, and the interviewer gradually dives deeper in one or multiple aspects of the project, sometimes until you get stuck (so it's totally ok to get stuck, maybe just not too early!).

The best advice to prepare for this interview is to know the details of what you've worked on  before (really well), even if it's 5 years ago (and not be like that guy who once replied "hmm ... I worked on this 5 years ago and I don't recall the details :D " ).

**Examples:**

- [TBD]

# <a name="breadth"></a> 4. ML Breadth/Fundamentals
As the name suggests, this interview is intended to evaluate your general knowledge of ML concepts both from theoretical and practical perspectives. Unlike ML depth interviews, the breadth interviews tend to follow a pretty similar structure and coverage amongst different interviewers and interviewees.

The best way to prepare for this interview is to review your notes from ML courses as well some high quality online courses and material. In particular, I found the following resources pretty helpful.

## Courses and review material:
- [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (you can also find the [lectures on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPLop4L2eGk&list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN) )
- [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects)
- [Udacity's deep learning nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) or  [Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) (for deep learning)


If you already know the concepts, the following resources are pretty useful for a quick review of different concepts:
- [StatQuest Machine Learning videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9_4yMHFhI&list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF)

# <a name="ml-sys"></a>  5. Machine Learning System Design

## Designing ML systems for production
This is one of my favorite interviews in which you can shine bright and up-level your career. I'd like to mention the following important notes:

- Remember, the goal of ML system design interview is NOT to measure your deep and detailed knowledge of different ML algorithms, but your ability to zoom out and design a production-level ML system that can be deployed as a service within a company's ML infrastructure.

- Deploying deep learning models in production can be challenging, and it is beyond training models with good performance. Several distinct components need to be designed and developed in order to deploy a production level deep learning system.

Once you learn about the basics, I highly recommend checking out different companies blogs on ML systems, which I learnt a lot from. You can refer to some of those resources in the subsection [ML at Companies](#ml-at-companies) below.

## ML System Design Flow
Approaching an ML system design problem follows a similar flow to the generic software system design.
For more insight on general system design interview you can e.g. check out:
- [Grokking the System Design Interview
](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview)
- [System design primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)

Below is a design flow that I would recommend:

1. Problem Description
    - What does it mean? 
    - Use cases 
    - Requirements
    - Assumptions 
2. Do we need ML to solve this problem? 
    - Trade off between impact and cost
      - Costs: Data collection, data annotation, compute 
    - if Yes, go to the next topic. If No, follow a general system design flow. 
3. ML Metrics 
      - Accuracy metrics: 
          - imbalanced data?
